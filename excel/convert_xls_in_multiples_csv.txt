-- Change  "local:=True" to "False" if csv gets separeted by , (comma)
-- it dependes of office language



-----------------------------


1. Create a new folder for the workbook that you want to split, because the split Excel files will be stayed at the same folder as this master workbook.

2. Hold down the ALT + F11 keys in Excel, and it opens the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications window.

3. Click Insert > Module, and paste the following code in the Module Window.



Sub Splitbook()
'Updateby20140612
Dim xPath As String
xPath = Application.ActiveWorkbook.Path
Application.ScreenUpdating = False
Application.DisplayAlerts = False
For Each xWs In ThisWorkbook.Sheets
    xWs.Copy
    Application.ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=xPath & "\" & xWs.Name & ".xls"
    Application.ActiveWorkbook.Close False
Next
Application.DisplayAlerts = True
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub


4. Press the F5 key to run this code. And the workbook is split to separate Excel files in the same folder with the original workbook. See screenshot:

		Dim xcsvFile As String
		xPath = Application.ActiveWorkbook.Path

			Application.ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=XPath & "\" & xcsvFile, Local:=True, _
			FileFormat: = xlCSV, CreateBackup: = False
			Application.ActiveWorkbook.Saved = True
			Application.ActiveWorkbook.Close
		Next
	End Sub

Sub ExportSheetsToText()
    Dim xWs As Worksheet
    Dim xTextFile As String
    For Each xWs In Application.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
        xWs.Copy
        xTextFile = CurDir & "\" & xWs.Name & ".txt"
        Application.ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename: = xTextFile, FileFormat: = xlText
        Application.ActiveWorkbook.Saved = True
